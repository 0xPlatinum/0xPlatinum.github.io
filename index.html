        <p width="200", height="200">
            I am a 20 year old student at ASU currently pursing an Applied Computing (Cybersecurity) Degree.
            I often do hacking in my free time on sites such as HackTheBox, TryHackMe, and PicoCTF.
            I love metal/rock/indie/alternative music, like Parkway Drive, Falling In Reverse, Wallows, and Linkin Park.
            I am proficient in Python and Java, and know basic HTML as well.
            Welcome to my page.

            My current goals are to gain certifications and an internship, hopefully the former leading to the latter.
        I am currently attempting the OSCP, with my exam scheduled for November 28th, during break.
        I have been applying like crazy to any internships I could get my hands on.
